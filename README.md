# Flutter Bloc Feature-First Demo App

A modular, **feature-first Flutter project** demonstrating **Bloc state management**, API integration, theming, localization, and reusable components. This project is structured to showcase real-world Flutter development practices, including full-stack integration with repositories, services, and REST APIs.

---

## Features

- **Feature-first architecture**: Each feature (login, songs, splash) is self-contained with its own Bloc, repository, and UI components.
- **State management**: Bloc pattern used for managing state in each feature.
- **Networking & API Handling**: Centralized network layer for REST APIs with error handling, loading, and response parsing.
- **Services**: Session management, local storage, and other reusable services in `core/services`.
- **Theming**: Light and dark themes with reusable theme configurations.
- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages using `.arb` files and `app_localizations`.
- **Reusable Widgets**: Custom UI components such as loading indicators, buttons, and network images.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
   cd Flutter-Bloc-Clean-Coding
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
   flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
   flutter run
```

---

## Usage

- Each feature is independent; you can add new features without affecting existing ones.
- Bloc handles all state updates and event logic.
- Repositories abstract API interactions and can be swapped with mocks for testing.

---

## Future Improvements

- Refactor to a stricter feature-first Clean Architecture with separate `domain`, `data`, and `presentation` layers.
- Add unit and widget tests for better coverage.
- Separate models per feature instead of a global `models/` folder.
- Improve folder naming consistency (`widget` → `ui` or `views`).
